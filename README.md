# spotiman

A high level wrapper around spotipy. The projects is in early stages so the functionality is very limited for now.

Also, includes spotiman_simple_curses executable, a simple experiment for a curses spotify player. It only manages Spotify Connect devices, doesn't do anything by itself. The curses application uses ncmpcpp keybindings.

I have no ambitious objectives for this project. It is mostly a playground for me. But, if you have suggestions or comments, fell free to let me know.
